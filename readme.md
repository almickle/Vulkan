# Feature Notes
## Project Structure
A part is the base atomic unit of organization. It reflects a single part with a single manufacturing process (sheet metal fab, cnc, additive, pcb), that can be quoted directly to a factory. Can contain auxillary manufacturing details like finish, color, etc. An assembly is composed of parts or sub-assemblies connected together in defined ways. A product is a full assembly of an end product or prototype. Projects are an organizational level that can contain multiple products and libraries of parts, etc (an organizational tool, not reflecting any physical relationship)
